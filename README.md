# Meme Coin Hunter

**Meme Coin Hunter** is a personal research project designed to identify early-stage meme cryptocurrencies by analyzing public data from Reddit, Twitter, and other social media platforms.

## Purpose

The goal is to detect meme coins that are gaining sudden social traction—before they appear on major exchanges—by tracking:
- New token mentions (e.g., $PEPE, $JEETS)
- Volume and velocity of mentions on social platforms
- Sentiment and virality using AI (OpenAI GPT-4)

## Features

- Scans posts from subreddits like r/CryptoCurrency, r/SatoshiStreetBets, and r/CryptoMoonShots
- Uses GPT to filter for meme-related tokens
- Scores and ranks coins based on real-time engagement
- Auto-updates daily and displays results in a dashboard
- For personal, educational, and non-commercial use only

## Status

This is an ongoing personal project and is not affiliated with Reddit, Twitter, or any cryptocurrency organization. It does not post, comment, or interact with Reddit in any way—only reads publicly available content for trend analysis.
